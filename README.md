# Rabies Economic Analysis

A comprehensive data science project for analyzing the economic impact of rabies prevention and control measures. This project includes a fully integrated Streamlit application that performs complete economic analysis internally, from mathematical modeling to visualization generation.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start - Comprehensive App

To run the complete analysis application:

```bash
python run_app.py
```

This launches a comprehensive Streamlit app that:
- Performs all mathematical modeling internally
- Calculates economic metrics and cost-effectiveness
- Generates the program summary table
- Creates 2x2 visualization plots
- Provides interactive results exploration

See `app/COMPREHENSIVE_APP_README.md` for detailed information about the comprehensive application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda for package management

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
